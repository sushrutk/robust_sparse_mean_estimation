# Robust Sparse Mean Estimation

A python implementation of algorithms in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08085. 

Prerequisites
==
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)


Explanation of Files
==
* `robustlib.py`: Library containing code for robust mean estimation and robust PCA algorithms as well as to plot comparisons between the performance of these algorithms across various noise models.

* `experiments_notebook.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with code to reproduce plots that are seen in the paper.
